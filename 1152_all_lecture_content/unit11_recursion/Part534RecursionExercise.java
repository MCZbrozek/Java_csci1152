/* TODO: Follow along:

Write a function that takes two integer inputs and returns one integer, which is the sum of the inputs. However, your function must recursively calculate the sum. This is perhaps the worst way to calculate a sum, but is simple recursion practice.

Consider how a sum of two numbers can be reduced to a simpler sum. The base case should be when one or both of the numbers to be summed is zero.

Call your recursive sum function from main and print the results to verify that it works.
