/*
When a method is called, a STACK FRAME is
PUSHED on the CALL STACK.
A stack frame usually stores:
	- Local variables
	- Arguments passed into the method
	- Information about the caller's stack frame
	- The return addressâ€”what the program should do after the function returns (i.e.: where it should "return to"). This is usually somewhere in the middle of the caller's code.

The call stack grows from bottom to top, but 
exceptions propagate from top to bottom:

The following program was inspired by this site:

public class Part330CallStack
{

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int b=0;
		Part330CallStack demo = new Part330CallStack();
		demo.method1(b);
		System.out.println("End of main");
	}
  
	public void method1(int b){
		System.out.println("In method1. Value recieved : "+b);

		//Uncommenting the following line triggers
		//the exception EVEN earlier. Note how the
		//exception differs.
		//int a = 7/b;

		method2(b);
	}
  
	public void method2(int b){
		System.out.println("In method2. Value recieved : "+b);

		//Uncommenting the following line triggers
		//the exception earlier. Note how the
		//exception differs.
		//int a = 7/b;

		method3();
	}
  
	public void method3(){
		System.out.println("In method3");
		//This divide by zero triggers an exception
		int a = 7/0;
	}
}
